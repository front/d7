OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------
This is a basic drush make file which can be used to set up a Drupal 7 site without needing to download all the files and modles.

----------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------
Requires drush_make (http://drupal.org/project/drush_make) and of course drush (http://drupal.org/project/drush) to work.

----------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------
The make file can be used to start any Drupal 7 project using the following workflow (assumes drush & drush_make are installed):

1. Create a new repository on git hub for the project code (remember the project name for step 2&3).

2. Fire up Terminal and navigate to the directory one level up from where you want your local working copy to be 
ie. your local working copy = Users/tom/sites/front/PROJECTNAME, navigate to Users/tom/sites/front 
DO NOT CREATE THE PROJECTNAME DIRECTORY (crush will handle that).

3. Run the following command in terminal:
drush make --force-complete drupal7.make ./PROJECTNAME

NOTE: It's important the PROJECTNAME has the same name as the git repository you have created for the project you are starting.

4. If it completes the command without errors you should now have a new folder with project name ie. Users/tom/sites/front/PROJECTNAME which should contain all the Drupal 7 files, a selection of modules & some extra themes.

5. Next initiate git in the project directory by running the following commands in terminal:

  cd PROJECTNAME
  git init
  git add -A
  git commit -m 'first commit for Drupal 7 code for the PROJECTNAME project'
  git remote add origin git@github.com:front/PROJECTNAME.git
  git push -u origin master
